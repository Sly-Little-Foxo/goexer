# goexer - Golang extended errors package

I like Golang errors extenders but can't found library that will be ideal for me.

E.g.

* https://github.com/pkg/errors - my favorite package, but does not allow to easy extend errors with custom fields.
* https://upspin.io/errors - support custom fields but only fixed inside library.

In this project I will try to realize flexible error type. I still does not know how it should be. I have several ideas. So, I do not recommend use this library before v1.0.0 will be done.
